        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>We are Vanilla Cleaning Services, and we’re thrilled you’ve decided to use our services, including, but not limited to, our technologies or functions offered on our website and all related sites, applications, customer service team, cleaners, and third-party vendors, all of which we refer to simply as the “Services.”</p>
        <p>These Terms of Service (which we call the “Terms”) are just so you’ll know the rules that govern our relationship with you. Although we’ve done our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places where these Terms may still read like a traditional contract. There’s a good reason for that: these Terms form a legally binding contract between you and Vanilla Cleaning Services, so please read them carefully.</p>
        <h2>1. Authority</h2>
        <p>By using the Services, you state that:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>you can form a binding contract with Vanilla Cleaning Services;</li>
          <li>you will comply with these Terms</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>2. Services</h2>
        <p><strong>A. Our Services Generally</strong></p>
        <p>Vanilla Cleaning Services agrees to provide you with the Services and you agree to pay the quoted price for the Services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing.</p>
        <p><strong>B. Cleaning Supplies and Equipment</strong></p>
        <p>We use and provide environmentally friendly supplies and nearly all equipment required for cleaning your space. </p>
        <p>In addition, Vanilla Cleaning Services requires that you have running hot water in order to properly perform our Services.</p>
        <p><strong>C. Great Clean Guarantee</strong></p>
        <p>“We get it right or we make it right.” </p>
        <p><strong>D. Safety</strong></p>
        <p>We strive to foster a safe environment for everyone. Our cleaning staff are employed, background checked, insured &amp; bonded, and professionally trained. We reserve the right to remove our employees from your space should the environment be/become unsafe.</p>
        <p><strong>E. Cancellation Policy</strong></p>
        <p>We assess a $50 cancellation fee to appointments not cancelled by 3PM EST the day before the appointment, unless that clean is a specialty clean. </p>
        <p>To be clear, if you have a recurring service, you’ll still need to cancel an appointment before 3PM EST the day before any particular appointment in order to avoid a cancellation fee, but you may cancel any later future appointments with no additional fee.</p>
        <p><strong>F. Damages</strong></p>
        <p>Our cleaning staff will conduct themselves professionally in your spac. In the rare event accidental damage occurs, you’ll need to notify our office within 48 hours of when the appointment is completed either by email (<a href="contact-us.html">support@vanillacleaning</a>) provide us with a photo and estimate of the damages, and be available to be contacted. We cannot guarantee reimbursement for damages that do not comply with this paragraph. Further, for potential caulking and grout damages, Vanilla Cleaning Services does not assume responsibility for the restoration of severely worn, stained or mildewed caulking and grout.</p>
        <h2>3. Privacy and Security</h2>
        <p>Your privacy matters to us. You can learn how we handle your information when you use our Services by reading our Privacy Policy. We encourage you to give the Privacy Policy a careful look because, by using our Services, you agree that Vanilla Cleaning Services can collect, use, and share your information in a manner consistent with that policy.</p>
        <p>If you feel that we’re not following our Privacy Policy, you may contact us either by email (<a href="https://www.myclean.com/contact@myclean.com">support@vanillacleaning</a>).</p>
        <h2>4. Modifying the Services and Termination</h2>
        <p>We may add or remove features, products, or functionalities to our Services, or suspend or stop the Services altogether. We may take any of these actions at any time without prior notice.</p>
        <p>While we hope you remain a lifelong customer, you can terminate the Services at any time and for any reason by deleting your account. Our Cancellation Policy will apply to appointments cancelled after 3PM EST the day before any cancelled appointment.</p>
        <p>Vanilla Cleaning Services may also terminate the Services it provides you at any time, for any reason, and without prior notice. That means that we may stop providing you with any Services, or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use our Services. For example, we may deactivate your account due to an outstanding balance or prolonged inactivity, and we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason.</p>
